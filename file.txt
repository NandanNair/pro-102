What I Will Code To Fix This Boring Things:
 Daily life:
  > I can create a auto task sorter to sort my tasks and organize myself of what do I need to do everyday, 
  including reading, clenaing, vaucumming, etc.
  > I can create a code that gives you points for every boring task you do and such points can give you prizes,
  this will make the boring tasks more interesting
 School:
 > I can code an app that paraphrases books and gives you the most important information to make 
 reading comprehension tests easier.
 Python:
 > I can try to use different ways to use the while loop, acces token and the terminal to find ways that
 are more interesting to do.
